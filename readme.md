#Project Euler

Project Euler is aimed to tackle mathmatical problems and solve them via use of computer programming

##Euler 1

The goal of Euler 1 is to get all the numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5 and add them all together in a total.

My solution is to put them all in a single if loop which counts from 0 to 1000 and while doing so it checks every value to see if it meets these conditions.

If it does it adds the number to the total which is then put into the terminal once the loop has finished.

To change the values it checks between change this part of the code;

(0...1000).each do |i|

The (0...1000) is the values that the code checks between.

##Euler 2

The second test is to print all the even numbers in the fibonarchi sequence for now this task is still a work in progress, for now this is currently the Fibonarchi sequence generated in ruby
